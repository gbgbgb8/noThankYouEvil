# No Thank You, Evil! Quick Players' Guide

## Introduction

**No Thank You, Evil!** is a tabletop roleplaying game designed to let you, your friends, and a guide create a story together using characters that you create. In the course of the story, you may encounter puzzles, new friends, distressed civilians in need of help, and bad guys that you need to fight or outwit as a group. Don't be afraid to experiment and get creative! The more silly and inventive you are, the more fun everyone playing the game will have.

## How to Play

The basic idea of *No Thank You, Evil!* is that the guide describes the world and situations in which your characters find themselves, and the players decide how they respond. When a player describes an action their character takes, the guide will give them a difficulty, usually between 1 and 6. This represents the minimum number that a player must roll on their dice to succeed in taking the action their character is attempting. (For actions that have difficulty 1, the character automatically succeeds.)

### Character Pools

Your character's main traits are represented on your character sheet by four "pools" of ability points:

- **Tough**: For tasks that require strength or sturdiness. If your character gets hurt, you'll usually lose Tough points.
- **Fast**: For speed, sneakiness, and tasks requiring dexterity or precision.
- **Smart**: For noticing things or solving problems.
- **Awesome**: Special points you can spend to help others in your group by lowering the difficulty of their tasks by 1.

You can spend points from these pools to accomplish tasks or lower the difficulty of actions by "Trying Harder" (spending an extra point to decrease difficulty by 1). If you run out of points in a pool, you can spend a Fun point to refill your pools.

### Combat Overview

Combat is the most rule-heavy part of the game. Here's a quick overview:

- Once players decide to fight a bad guy, each player takes turns deciding what their character does.
- A character can either **move** or **fight**, but not both.
- Players can also decide if their companion takes an action (e.g., attacking counts as the player's fighting action).
- The guide sets the difficulty for each action.
- Rolling a 1 may cause trouble, while rolling a 6 can lead to an even better outcome.
- After players act, bad guys get a turn to fight back, and players may need to make defense rolls to avoid damage.

Combat continues until one side is defeated.

### The Guide's Role

The guide describes the world, introduces new characters, and helps players if they are unsure. You can ask the guide for help at any time, even during combat. Remember, *No Thank You, Evil!* is meant to be fun for everyone, so if you have questions or problems, let the guide know!

## Creating a Character

Creating a character is simple: players write a sentence describing their character using a **name**, a **noun** (what the character is), and an **adjective** (how the character is). For example: "Conan the Librarian is a cool fighter."

### Nouns

Choose a noun to determine your character's type and ability balance:

- **Astronaut**: Very smart and pretty fast, but not as friendly. **Armor**. Knack: *Blastoff* (costs 1 Fast) – Leap off the ground with ease.
- **Creature**: Very tough and pretty friendly, but not the smartest. **Armor**. Knack: *Rawr!* (costs 1 Tough) – Frighten or intimidate a bad guy for one round.
- **Fighter**: Super tough and pretty friendly, but not quick or clever. **Armor**. Knack: *Knockout* (costs 1 Tough) – Make a hurt bad guy lose their next turn.
- **Kid**: Pretty fast and friendly, a little less tough and smart. **Hustle**. Knack: *Scramble* (costs 1 Fast) – Jump, climb, or leap nearly any obstacle.
- **Pirate**: Very fast and pretty tough, but not friendly. **Hustle**. Knack: *Plunder* (costs 1 Fast) – Open any locked treasure chest.
- **Princess (or Prince)**: Very friendly, fairly smart and tough, but not fast. **Hustle**. Knack: *Charm* (costs 1 Smart) – Charm a bad guy to not attack for one round.
- **Robot**: Pretty smart and tough, less friendly and fast. **Armor**. Knack: *Solve* (costs 1 Smart) – Say "bleep bloop!" to solve a problem.
- **Spy**: Pretty fast and smart, less tough and friendly. **Hustle**. Knack: *Sneak* (costs 1 Fast) – Fade into shadows to remain unseen.
- **Superhero**: Very tough and pretty friendly, but not clever. **Armor**. Knack: *Smash!* (costs 1 Tough) – Yell "I'll save the day!" to succeed at non-fighting actions.
- **Wizard**: Very fast and pretty smart, but not friendly. **Hustle**. Knack: *Ta-da!* (costs 1 Smart) – Cast a convincing illusion.

### Adjectives

Choose an adjective to reflect your character's personality and gain a +1 bonus to a specific pool:

- **Cool**: +1 Smart  
- **Fantastic**: +1 Awesome  
- **Fast**: +1 Fast  
- **Kind**: +1 Awesome  
- **Powerful**: +1 Tough  
- **Sneaky**: +1 Fast  
- **Super Smart**: +1 Smart  
- **Super Strong**: +1 Tough  

### Stuff

Your character starts with basic adventuring supplies (rope, flashlight, snacks) and a weapon (ranged or melee, depending on their noun). You can add other items with the guide's approval.

### Defense

Each character has a defense bonus:

- **Armor**: Subtract 1 from damage taken.  
- **Hustle**: Subtract 1 from the defense difficulty number.  

Your noun determines your defense type.

### Knack

Each noun comes with a unique knack, an ability you can use by spending a point from the relevant pool (no dice roll required).

### Coins

Coins allow your character to buy things, though opportunities to do so may not always arise.

### Disputes

If there's confusion or disagreement, the guide's word is final. The goal is to build a fun story for everyone.

## Companions

Companions are creatures or friends that accompany your character. You control them and decide their actions. Each companion has a **cypher**, a one-time special ability. After using it, you can feed your companion a treat to learn a new cypher.

- **Awesome Alien**: Starting cypher: *Lifesaver* – Protects you from all damage once.  
- **Big Bad Wolf**: Starting cypher: *Big Ears* – Alerts you to nearby danger.
